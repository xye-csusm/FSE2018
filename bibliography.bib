abstract ={The optimal treatment of patients with cancer depends on
 establishing accurate diagnoses by using a complex combination of
 clinical and histopathological data. In some instances, this task is
 difficult or impossible because of atypical clinical presentation or
 histopathology. To determine whether the diagnosis of multiple common
 adult malignancies could be achieved purely by molecular
 classification, we subjected 218 tumor samples, spanning 14
 common tumor types, and 90 normal tissue samples to oligonucleotide
 microarray gene expression analysis. The expression levels of 16,063
 genes and expressed sequence tags were used to evaluate the accuracy of
 a multiclass classifier based on a support vector machine algorithm.
 Overall classification accuracy was 78%, far exceeding the accuracy of
 random classification (9%). Poorly differentiated cancers resulted in
 low-confidence predictions and could not be accurately classified
 according to their tissue of origin, indicating that they are
 molecularly distinct entities with dramatically different gene
 expression patterns compared with their well differentiated
 counterparts. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility
 of accurate, multiclass molecular cancer classification and suggest a
 strategy for future clinical implementation of molecular cancer
 diagnostics.},
